3,在水星看日出,Mercury Sunrise Expedition: Closest to the Sun!,Mercury,"Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth days – just over two years on Mercury.","https://science.nasa.gov/mercury/facts/, https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11350",Mercury/PIA11350.jpg

12,造訪金星的峽谷,Visiting Cleopatra Crater,Venus,"Cleopatra is a double-ring impact basin about 100 kilometers (62 miles) in diameter and 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) deep. A steep-walled, winding channel a few kilometers wide breaks through the rough terrain surrounding the crater rim. A large amount of lava originating in Cleopatra flowed through this channel and filled valleys in Fortuna Tessera. Cleopatra is superimposed on the structures of Maxwell Montes and appears to be undeformed, indicating that Cleopatra is relatively young.",https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia00149-venus-maxwell-montes-and-cleopatra-crater,Venus/Maxwell.jpeg

15,國際太空站參訪,Visiting the International Space Station,Earth/ISS,"The International Space Station program is a collaborative effort that brings together international flight crews, multiple launch vehicles, globally distributed launch and flight operations, training, engineering, and development facilities, communications networks, and the international scientific research community. Five partner agencies, including NASA, operate the ISS, with each responsible for the hardware it provides. The ISS has been continuously inhabited since 2000, with over 260 individuals from 21 countries participating in more than 60 Expeditions. It serves as a microgravity laboratory for scientific experiments, technological demonstrations, and international collaboration.",https://www.nasa.gov/reference/international-space-station/,Earth/ISS.png
23,月震體驗,Experience Moonquakes,Earth/Moon,"Astronauts left several Passive Seismic Experiments (PSE) on the lunar surface during the Apollo missions. The seismometers on these devices detected moonquakes, impacts from meteorites, and impacts of man-made origin (also known as artificial impacts). Numerous moonquakes occur during sunset and sunrise when the lunar surface temperature changes rapidly on either side of the day/night terminator line. Many of those moonquakes even occur on mapped fault lines.

17,成為阿姆斯壯,Become Armstrong: Walk on the Moon to Relive the Experience of Armstrong's Lunar Landing!,Earth/Moon,"Armstrong is probably best known as the commander of NASA’s Apollo 11 mission to the moon, during which he became the first person to set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969. Armstrong amassed a total of eight days and 14 hours in space during two space flights, including two hours and 14 minutes walking on the moon. In March 1966, he commanded the Gemini 8 orbital space flight with David Scott as pilot that accomplished the first successful docking of two vehicles in orbit. That was followed by the famed Apollo 11 lunar landing mission in July 1969.",https://www.nasa.gov/people/neil-a-armstrong/,Earth/Armstrong.webp

34,在火星上搜集垃圾，為環保更盡一份力,Removing Artificial Objects to Cleanse Mars,Mars,"During the past era of the space race, numerous Mars probes were launched in the pursuit of Mars exploration. Among them, many faced failures, whether due to crashes or retirement. However, these spacecraft were not retrieved, and they now remain on Mars, becoming artificial objects on Mars. Today, we have the opportunity to walk in the footsteps of history, while also taking the initiative to collect and remove them. This not only contributes to a cleaner Martian environment but also opens up the possibility for new beginnings and the potential for future life to thrive on Mars.",Rover's Backshell Seen From the Air – NASA Mars Exploration,Mars/Rover's_Backshell_Seen_From_the_Air.png

31,火星地形探索:造訪太陽系中的最高峰,Conquer Olympus Mons: Explore the Tallest Volcano in the Solar System,Mars,"Olympus Mons is the largest known volcano in the Solar System. It is 27 kilometers high, over 600 kilometers at the base, and is surrounded by a well-defined scarp that is up to 6 km high. Lava flows drape over the scarp in places. Much of the plains surrounding the volcano are covered by the ridged and grooved 'aureole' of Olympus Mons. The origin of the aureole is controversial, but may be related to gravity sliding off of the flanks of an ancestral volcano. The summit caldera (central depression) is almost 3 km deep and 25 km across. It probably formed from recurrent collapse following drainage of magma resulting from flank eruptions.",https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia00300-olympus-mons,Mars/Olympus_Mons.jpg
