# Welcome to PTO!

This project is a web-based single-player game inspired by the concept of "Snakes and Ladders". It conveys educational information related to the planets of solar system and eventually generates a random travel route for the users.

# How to play

The game begins by rolling a dice to determine the number of steps to move forward. You may encounter unexpected events (e.g., wormholes, asteroids), similar to those in real space, which can either propel you forward or push you backward.

Most of the squares trigger different events. In this game, players will encounter four types of events:

* Landmark Event: Visit a specific landmark on a planet and learn about some interesting stories associated with it.
* Journey Event: Continue traveling through space with no special events occurring.
* Wormhole Event: Enter a wormhole and traverse to a distant location.
* Asteroid Impact Event: Experience an asteroid impact and move back a few steps in the journey.

For journey event, you can explore the following spots:

* Mercury Introduction
* Mercury Sunrise Expedition: Closest to the Sun!
* Find the Water Ice in the Crater
* Visit Caloris Montes: The highest mountain on the Mercury
* Spider on the Mercury?!
* The impact of MESSENGER on the surface of Mercury
* Venus Introduction
* Lava Spectacle: Witness the Intense Volcanic Activity on Venus!
* Visiting Maxwell Montes
* Visiting Cleopatra Crater
* Earth Introduction
* Visiting the International Space Station
* Experience Moonquakes
* Become Armstrong: Walk on the Moon to Relive the Experience of Armstrong's Lunar Landing!
* Low Gravity Experience
* Viewing Earth from the Moon
* Mars Introduction
* Visit Stickney Crater: The Most Prominent Feature on Phobos
* Join with Rover
* Removing Artificial Objects to Cleanse Mars
* Stargazing on Mars: An Experience Unlike Earth's
* Conquer Olympus Mons: Explore the Tallest Volcano in the Solar System
* A Massive and Mysterious Canyon

For the development of this project, we primarily utilize JavaScript, CSS, and HTML as the programming languages. Furthermore, we have conducted extensive research on the planets in the solar system and have suggested various engaging activities for users to enjoy. While users may not physically travel through space during the planning of their tourism, we can all gain valuable insights from the information and images provided by NASA and other collaborating partners.
