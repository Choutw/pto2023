6,Lava Spectacle: Witness the Intense Volcanic Activity on Venus!,Venus,"Venus displays compelling evidence of intense volcanic activity, potentially surpassing Earth in the number of volcanoes. As a result, the surface of Venus boasts extensive lava plains where visitors can witness these spectacular lava flows. However, ensuring a safe viewing experience requires proper observation equipment and protection.",
7,Visiting the International Space Station,Earth/ISS,"The International Space Station program is a collaborative effort that brings together international flight crews, multiple launch vehicles, globally distributed launch and flight operations, training, engineering, and development facilities, communications networks, and the international scientific research community. Five partner agencies, including NASA, operate the ISS, with each responsible for the hardware it provides. The ISS has been continuously inhabited since 2000, with over 260 individuals from 21 countries participating in more than 60 Expeditions. It serves as a microgravity laboratory for scientific experiments, technological demonstrations, and international collaboration.",https://www.nasa.gov/reference/international-space-station/
12,Experience Moonquakes,Earth/Moon,"Astronauts left several Passive Seismic Experiments (PSE) on the lunar surface during the Apollo missions. The seismometers on these devices detected moonquakes, impacts from meteorites, and impacts of man-made origin (also known as artificial impacts). Numerous moonquakes occur during sunset and sunrise when the lunar surface temperature changes rapidly on either side of the day/night terminator line. Many of those moonquakes even occur on mapped fault lines.

9,Become Armstrong: Walk on the Moon to Relive the Experience of Armstrong's Lunar Landing!,Earth/Moon,"Armstrong is probably best known as the commander of NASA’s Apollo 11 mission to the moon, during which he became the first person to set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969. Armstrong amassed a total of eight days and 14 hours in space during two space flights, including two hours and 14 minutes walking on the moon. In March 1966, he commanded the Gemini 8 orbital space flight with David Scott as pilot that accomplished the first successful docking of two vehicles in orbit. That was followed by the famed Apollo 11 lunar landing mission in July 1969.",https://www.nasa.gov/people/neil-a-armstrong/
10,Visit Stickney Crater: The Most Prominent Feature on Phobos,Mars/Phobos,"The most prominent feature on Phobos is Stickney Crater, which is named for Chloe Angeline Stickney Hall, mathematician and wife of astronomer Asaph Hall. Asaph Hall discovered both the Red Planet's moons in 1877. Stickney crater is about 6-miles (9.7 kilometers) wide, and takes up about half the moon's surface. NASA Mars Global Surveyor took images of the crater, and it appears to be filled with fine dust, with evidence of boulders sliding down its sloped surface.",https://science.nasa.gov/mars/moons/phobos/
